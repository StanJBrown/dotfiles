# Why University of Waterloo?
- Waterloo's links to the industry (Co-Op)
- One of the top universities on big companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple
- Engineering Facilities
- Entrepreneurship, MapleSoft, QNX, Blackberry, Pebble, Aeryon
- Full intellectural-property rights to inventions


# Why Mechanical and Mechanical Engineering or why this program?
- Started Physics, but realized was better at Computer Science
- Discovered Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at MSc
- Decided to do a PhD in search of an Automated Data Minining Framework
- Discovered Evolutionary Algorithms
- Realized really wanted to integrate Machine Learning techniques to Robotics
- After one year of PhD I took the opportunity to do an internship to think
  about my future, and decided I will drop out of the PhD at St Andrews,
  because the combination of divergence of research interest and lack of
  Engineering department meant it would be very difficult for me to seek
  collaboration and help for the change of research interest.
- Doing this internship in Silicon Valley has made me realize I would really
  like to apply Machine Learning techniques to Engineering problems,
  specifically in the Drones sphere.
- From our discussion of research projects at WAVE lab, I feel there are several
  different research avenues to which we could work together on, from CGP to
  evolve a neural network, to evolving accurate models with little data.
- One important reason why I chose to do this is because if I really wanted to
  conduct research in Robotics, I need to expand my knowledge of what ML
  techniques are being used in actual Engineering, don't want to get stuck in
  Evolutionary Algorithms.

# What skills do you have that wil help you succeed on this course?
- Background in Physics with good grades in fundamental mathematics
- Have taken courses in Digital Logic, Introduction to Electrical Engineering
- Was a design technology student in High School, have done some CAD and
  technical drawings
- Familiarity with Wood / Metal Lathes
- Very good programming skills, both high level (Python) and low level (C)
- Have been working on Physics Engine, QFly and Evolutionary Algorithms
- Have help perform Motion Planning simulations


# What skills do I lack?
- Need to revise Mathematics (hence using Physics Engine as a driving force to
  remind myself of linear algebra).
- Need to revise Electrical Engineering (Hense using QFly as a driving force to
  to do that)
- Remind myself how to use CAD programs such as SolidEdge


# Why Evolutionary Algorithms are great for the problem?
- Evolutionary algorithms are great for problems where you don't know the how
  to approach the problem itself, but you will know the answer when you see it
- Takes a lot of compute resource but can potentially build a robust solution.
- Potential Parameter search problem
    - Off-line
        - Brute Force Parameter Search
        - Racing Algorithm
        - Meta-GA
    - On-line
        - Varying the Population Sizes
        - Varying probability of crossover / mutation rates
- Emphasize there are other algorithms that needs to be considered


# Career Goals
- Want to keep working in developing Machine Learning techniques to solve
  Engineering problems, such as motion planning, control and computer vision.
  I believe it is the future and I would like to be part of the driving force
  that pushes the boundaries.
- With the advent of quadcopters, I feel it is now a race to build a fully
  autonomous fail-save quadcopter for applications in package-delivery,
  search and rescue, to movies, entertainment and sport.
- There are also potenial benefits in creating humanoid robotics capable of
  tending the old, by helping patients get up. Japan is on pace to lose a third
  of its population in the next 50 years, over 40% will be over 65 in 2060.
