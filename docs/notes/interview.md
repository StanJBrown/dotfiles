# Interview Cheat Sheet
## Five key points I want them to remember
- Fast learner (switch from Physics to Computer Science)
- Have good coding practices
- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning student
- I have something ready to be used (playground / evolve)

## Brilliant Ideas
- Use of Genetic Programming for Data Driven search (Symbolic Regression)
- Feedback Control Systems evolved using GP

## My short/long term goals
- Explore how or if Genetic Programming is useful in the industry
- See if parameter setting is a problem to make algorithms go faster
- Finish my PhD and apply my academic knowledge in the industry
- Build a startup based on playground for a variety of problems (e.g. circuit design)

## Reasons why I rock
- Already have a working GP framework; playground
- Mathematically Analytical
- Good coding practices
- Have a wide range of interests
- Academic/Scientific

## My overall work/team philosophy
- Everyone should adhere to common understanding of coding standards and practices
- Documentation is paramount to project success
- Best ideas always wins
- When in doubt do some benchmarks
- Nothing is permanent

## Specific Challenges
- Academia offers a limited view on the problem area for A.I.



# QUESTIONS
Who are the companies?
What is the biggest challenge facing the organization today?
What are the criteria that you are looking for in the successful candidate for this position?

Association for UnManned Vechicle Systems International reported in 2013,
precision argriculture accounts for 80% of the potential commercial market for
UAV systems. The market is predicted to hit USD $3 billion in the next 3 years,
cresting to USD $30 billion in the coming decade.


## Competitors
Precision Hawk
CropCam
    - 700 grams: Low cost sensor
    - 1.3 kg payload: Medium cost sensor
    - 2 kg payload: High cost sensor
    - $10,000 -> $30,000





# Why Do You Want To Work For Us? or Tell me about yourself
- My research in Genetic Programming could be useful for the industry
- Being in the academia, I have a very limited view of whether GP is useful or not.
- I would like to use the opportunity withMavrx  to expand on experience solving real world problems.
- Would like to experience the start-up culture
- Have aspirations to live in Sillicon Valley

# What has been the biggest disappointment in your life?
- A-level results, having grades CCD in Maths, Physics, and Biology
- Went to Loughborough University to do a Foundation Year in Science and Engineering
- Finished with Good Grades and transfered to top 10 Physics undergraduate course at Heriot-Watt Uni
