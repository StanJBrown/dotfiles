IMPORTANT: When running tmux in a terminal you need to be able to send commands
to tmux. In tmux vocabulary, they call it the prefix (which is ctrl-b in our
case). This tells the terminal I want to send a command to tmux, for example,
lets say I want to create a new tmux tab (which is prefix + c), you would then
press ctrl-b + c to create a new tab.
