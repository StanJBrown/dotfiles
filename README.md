This dotfile repo contains a backup of my custom configuration files. Of
particular interest to you is probably `init.sh`, this shell script essentially
creates all kinds of symlinks to make the configuration files active on the
system.

This dotfile repo contains configuration for:

    - bash
    - shell keyboard mapping (inputrc)
    - tmux
    - vim
    - terminal fonts
